## Project Overview

This project is a Kaggle dataset project I made as a personal portfolio.  
In this project, I focus on the **USA market** to answer a set of business questions below.

### 3. Store Performance

- How do the sales of top-performing cities (e.g., New York, Los Angeles, Houston) compare?  
- Are there any underperforming stores that could benefit from targeted campaigns?

### 4. Product Sales Insights

## Recommendations (Based on Dashboard Insights)

1. Focus **marketing efforts** and **inventory buildup for Q4** (especially Oct–Dec) where customer purchasing behavior is strongest.

2. Since the majority of customers are **female** and aged **18–25**:  
   - Tailor campaigns and product lines to younger, female audiences  
   - Explore TikTok/Instagram-focused marketing and Gen-Z style trends

3. Invest more in high-performing locations (New York, Los Angeles) with **additional stock and campaigns**.  
   Furthermore, **audit lower-performing stores** (Phoenix, Chicago) to identify operational or demographic issues.

4. Continue prioritizing the **Holiday, Fall, and Early campaigns** because they generate high revenue.  
   **Black Friday Sale** is the lowest but it's still understandable since it only took 1 day. However,  
   the **New Year Winter Sale** runs for 10 days but still shows low revenue, which is worth investigating.  
   The store can consider optimizing product selections or offering bundled deals to boost performance during this period.

5. Because sales peak in **Q4** and lowest in **Q1**, the store can use **Q1 for inventory resets and planning**.
