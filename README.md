This raw dataset contains **6 CSV Files** with in total **over 5 Million Rows**.  

This project is a kaggle dataset project i made as a personal portfolio, on this project i'll be focusing on the USA Market to answer
a set of questions below:

7. Geographic Insights

After answering and visualizing the data on Microsoft Power BI, here are my recommendations:

1. Focus **marketing efforts** and **inventory buildup for Q4** (especially Octâ€“Dec) where customer purchasing behavior is strongest.
   
2. Since majority of gender is **female** and majority of customer age is **18-25**. Consider **Tailoring campaigns and product lines to younger, female audiences**
   and **Explore TikTok/Instagram-focused marketing** and **Gen-Z style trends**.
   
3. Invest more in high-performing locations (NY, LA) with **additional stock and campaigns**.Furthermore **Audit lower-performing stores** to identify operational or demographic issues.
 
4. Continue **prioritizing the Holiday, Fall, and Spring campaigns** because it generated high revenue. **Reinvestigate Black Friday strategies**, consider longer discount windows, optimize products offered, or
   provide bundling offers.
   
6. Because sales peak in Q4 and lowest in Q1, the store can use **Q1 for inventory resets, planning, and lighter promotions**.
